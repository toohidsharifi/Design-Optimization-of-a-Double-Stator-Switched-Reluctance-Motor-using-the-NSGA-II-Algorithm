#Multi-Objective Design Optimization of a Double-Stator Switched Reluctance Motor using the NSGA-II Algorithm
Switched reluctance motors (SRMs) are gaining attention for various applications due to their robust, magnet-free construction. However, their widespread adoption is often hindered by inherent drawbacks, namely high torque ripple and low torque density. This report investigates the use of a double-stator switched reluctance motor (DSSRM) topology as a means to mitigate these issues. While the dual-stator configuration inherently reduces torque ripple, achieving high torque density remains a significant design challenge that necessitates a sophisticated optimization approach. This study presents a multi-objective design optimization of a DSSRM using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The optimization aims to simultaneously maximize average torque and efficiency while minimizing torque ripple and manufacturing cost. These objectives are inherently conflicting, demanding a trade-off solution. Through a detailed analysis of the 2-D and 3-D Pareto fronts, a final optimal design is selected. The selection prioritizes average torque and efficiency, resulting in a design that not only offers the highest torque but also the highest efficiency among the optimal set, with a reasonably low torque ripple compared to the classical SRM and initial DSSRM machines, validating the effectiveness of the dual-stator topology combined with the NSGA-II optimization methodology.
